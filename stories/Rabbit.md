```
The long summer is finished. 
Rabbit doesn't like the little pool.
He wants the beautiful ocean.
He takes food and clothes.
He goes out.
He is on the way to the ocean.
A mushroom forest stops him.
The mushroom heads over him. 
there is no sunshine below.
too dark to see.
Rabbit tries to go ahead.
he falls from time to time.
He says “This is the last time”.
He stands up again.		
bugs appear.
bugs shine.
the dark is gone.
