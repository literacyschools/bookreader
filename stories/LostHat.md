```
There is a thing that makes Mr.Rabbit unhappy.
Where is his yellow hat?
He thinks someone stole it on the home party.
The hat is so beautiful that everyone wants it.
Mr.Rabbit asks his best friend Mrs.Wolf.
"Did you take my cat by mistake?"
Mrs.Wolf turns angry.
She says:”you are not my friend anymore”
And then shuts the door with a bang.
The bang is the sound of breaking heart for both of them too.
So is it really important where the hat is?
