There is a thing that makes Mr.Rabbit unhappy for a few months.
Where is his yellow hat?
He thinks someone stole it on the home party for his two years old birthday.
The hat is so beautiful that everyone wants it.
Mr.Rabbit asks his best friend Mrs.Wolf if he took his cat by mistake.
She turns angry.
she says:”you are not my friend anymore” and shut the door with a bang.
The sound bang is the sound of breaking heart for both of them too.
So is it really important where the hat is?
